## Inspiration
Traveling is the joy and hobby of many people. Being able to spend time in a new place and enjoying the new culture makes lives become more meaningful. As the pandemic is coming to an end, the need and passion for travel of people are increasing. Even though English is the common language and many local people know English, it is still important to have some translation tools that can assist people while traveling to communicate with the locals better.

These facts  point to the need for having a site that not only assists travelers with booking hotel rooms, flights, taxis, etc. but also helps them communicate well with the locals. Because of these requirements, Travel Talk came to life. 

Our site, Travel Talk, provides booking services for hotel rooms, flight, travel, taxis, etc. We also provide translation services from English to French, Japanese, and Hindi (Indian). In the future, we plan to expand our translation service to more languages.

Further, we have a chat bot , called Alice, that assists with the booking and explains about our translation service. After the booking is done, an automatic message is sent to the customer through WhatsApp and confirms the booking. Further, customers can send a text message to our phone number and an automatic text as well as phone call will reach out to them for further assistance.
